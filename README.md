# Fifa_Player_OverAll_Rating_Prediction

## What kind of data are we using?

I found a large dataset of the FIFA games on Kaggle. The dataset consists of data from FIFA 15 to FIFA 20. We will be using the latest FIFA game in the dataset which is FIFA 20. The dataset can be downloaded from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/stefanoleone992/fifa-20-complete-player-dataset). The dataset consists of 18,278 rows and 104 columns. The columns contain features such as Player Name, Age, Height, Weight, Nationality, and many more. Since we are trying to predict the overall rating, we would only need to focus on the features that have correlations with the overall rating, but weâ€™ll get to that later.
